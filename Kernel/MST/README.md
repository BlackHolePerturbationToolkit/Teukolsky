# MST

Mathematica code for the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) method for solving the Regge-Wheeler and Teukolsky equations.

For information on the MST method see, e.g., ["Analytic Black Hole Perturbation Approach to Gravitational Radiation", M. Sasaki, T. Tagoshi, Living Reviews in Relativity, 6, (2003)](http://doi.org/10.12942/lrr-2003-6)

This code is used by the [Teukolsky](https://bhptoolkit.org/Teukolsky/) and [ReggeWheeler](https://bhptoolkit.org/ReggeWheeler) packages.
